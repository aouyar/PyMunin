PyMunin - Python Multigraph Munin Plugins
=========================================

Python Module for developing Munin Multigraph Monitoring Plugins.

Regular Munin Plugins employ one-plugin one-graph logic and require the 
execution of a script for data retrieval for each graph.
Multigraph plugins permit retrieval of data for multiple graphs in one execution 
run (one-plugin many-graphs), reducing the processing time and delay for the 
fetch cycle significantly.
More information on Multigraph Plugins can be found in the 
[Munin Wiki](http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/):

* [Multigraph Plugins](http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/MultigraphSampleOutput)
* [Multigraph Plugin Protocol](http://munin-monitoring.org/wiki/protocol-multigraph)

The plugins consist of the following components:

* The _pymunin_ module _(./plugins/pymunin)_ implements the base classes for
  developing Munin plugins.
* The plugin logic is implemented in the plugin scripts in _./plugins_.
* The actual data retrieval logic is separated from the plugins to facilitate
  code reuse. Individual modules in the directory _./pysysinfo_ implement classes 
  for getting the monitoring data and returning them in dictionary objects. 
  The separation of the data retrieval logic should facilitate the use of the 
  same code in other monitoring solutions.

Although the solution is focused on implementing _Multigraph Plugins_ the module
also supports simple single graph plugins.

The initial design of the solution was inspired by 
[python-munin](https://github.com/samuel/python-munin) 
by [samuel](https://github.com/samuel) (Samuel Stauffer).


Munin Plugins
-------------

Multigraph Monitoring Plugins for the following applications are already
included:

* Apache Tomcat
* Apache Web Server
* Asterisk Telephony Server
* Disk Usage
* Disk I/O
* FreeSWITCH Soft Switch
* Memcached
* MySQL Database
* Network Interface Traffic and Errors
* Network Connection Stats (netstat)
* Nginx Web Server
* NTP - Time Server
* PHP APC - PHP Cache
* PHP FPM (FastCGI Process Manager)
* PostgreSQL Database
* Processes and Threads
* System Resources 
  (Load, CPU, Memory, Processes, Interrupts, Paging, Swapping, etc.)
* Sangoma Wanpipe Telephony Interfaces

Classes for retrieving stats are available, but no plugins have been developed
yet for the following:

* Squid Web Proxy


Documentation
-------------

The documentation for the project and sample graphs for plugins will be 
published in the [PyMunin Project Web Page](http://aouyar.github.com/PyMunin/)


Collaboration
-------------

I would be happy to receive suggestions on improving the code for developing 
Munin Plugins. Alternatively you can use the _Issues_ functionality of _GitHub_ 
to document problems and to propose improvements. You can use the internal 
messaging system of _GitHub_ or my e-mail address in case you prefer to 
contact me directly.

I hope that by sharing the code, the existing plugins will get more testing and 
receive improvements, and many more Multigraph plugins will be developed 
collaboratively.

I would be glad to receive some sample graphs from anyone using the plugins.


Licensing
---------

_PyMunin_ is copyrighted free software made available under the terms of the 
_GPL License Version 3_ or later.

See the _COPYING_ file that acompanies the code for full licensing information.

Installation
------------

### Installation of the Libraries ###

It is easiest to install using [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/):

    pip install git+https://github.com/aouyar/PyMunin.git#egg=PyMunin

This will unpack the plugins as console scripts into the install _bin_
directory. Each of the scripts will be prefixed with pymunin (i.e. pymunin-apachestats).
The location will be _/usr/local/bin/_ if installed globally or 
_$VIRTUAL_ENV/bin/_ if installed in with [virtualenv](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

This will attempt to install the plugins to _/usr/share/munin/plugins_. If it fails
it will create a _pymunin-install_ script for you to use to copy the plugins from
the _bin_ directory to _/usr/share/munin/plugins_. The pymunin prefix will be dropped
in the process.

  
### Installation of the Plugins ###

* Enable the plugins just like the standard plugins by creating a symbolic links 
  in the _Munin Plugins Configuration Directory_ (_/etc/munin/plugins_).
* Configuration files for plugins can be created in the _Munin Plugins
  Configuration Directory_ (_/etc/munin/plugin-conf.d_). The environment 
  variables used by the plugin scripts are documented in the header part of the
  script code.


Troubleshooting
---------------

On error plugins return short error messages by default. Plugin debugging must
be enabled to return full trace for exceptions.

To enable plugin debugging in _munin-run_ use the _--pidebug_ option.
